Look for the green squares! More commits = More green 🟢

## How to Show Equal Contribution

**Strategy 1: Even Task Distribution**
- Each member works on their assigned area
- Similar number of commits per person
- Aim for ~20-30 commits per person per week

**Strategy 2: Pair Programming**
- Work together, but commit from different machines
- Use `--author` flag if needed:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add feature" --author="Name <email@example.com>"
```

**Strategy 3: Regular Commits**
- Don't wait until last day
- Commit small changes frequently
- Push every day

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ One person has 200 commits, others have 5
❌ All commits on last day
❌ All commits from one IP address
❌ No pull requests or code reviews
❌ Generic commit messages ("update", "fix")

---

## Good Practices

✅ Each member commits from their machine
✅ Commits spread across all 4 weeks
✅ Clear commit messages
✅ Pull requests with reviews
✅ Different members work on different files
✅ Regular team syncs documented
